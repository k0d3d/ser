# Lockit

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zeMirco/lockit.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zeMirco/lockit) [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/lockit.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/lockit)

Lockit is an authentication solution for [Express](http://expressjs.com/).

It consists of multiple single purpose modules:

 - [lockit-login](https://github.com/zeMirco/lockit-login)
 - [lockit-signup](https://github.com/zeMirco/lockit-signup)
 - [lockit-delete-account](https://github.com/zeMirco/lockit-delete-account)
 - [lockit-forgot-password](https://github.com/zeMirco/lockit-forgot-password)
 - [lockit-sendmail](https://github.com/zeMirco/lockit-sendmail)
 - [lockit-couchdb-adapter](https://github.com/zeMirco/lockit-couchdb-adapter)
 - [lockit-mongodb-adapter](https://github.com/zeMirco/lockit-mongodb-adapter)
 - [lockit-sql-adapter](https://github.com/zeMirco/lockit-sql-adapter)
 - [lockit-utilities](https://github.com/zeMirco/lockit-utilities)
 - [lockit-template-blank](https://github.com/zeMirco/lockit-template-blank)

## Installation

1. Install and require

  `npm install lockit`

  ```js
  var config = require('./config.js');
  var Lockit = require('lockit');
  
  var app = express();
  
  // express middleware
  // ...
  // sessions are required
  app.use(express.cookieParser('your secret here'));
  app.use(express.cookieSession());
  
  // use middleware before router so your own routes have access to
  // req.session.email and req.session.username
  var lockit = new Lockit(app, config);
  
  // you now have all the routes like /login, /signup, etc.
  // and you can listen on events. For example 'signup'
  lockit.on('signup', function(user, res) {
    console.log('a new user signed up');
    res.send('Welcome!');   // set signup.handleResponse to 'false' for this to work
  });
  
  app.use(app.router);
  // continue with express middleware
  // ...
  ```
  
2. Add styles

  Views are built with [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). 
  You can use [your own ones](#custom-views) though!
  Use Bootstrap CDN and add the following line to your `layout.jade`
  
  ```jade
  link(rel='stylesheet', href='//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.1.1/css/bootstrap.min.css')
  ```

3. Install database adapter 

  `npm install lockit-[DB]-adapter` where `[DB]` can be

  | Database | Command |
  | --- | --- |
  | [CouchDB](https://github.com/zeMirco/lockit-couchdb-adapter) | `npm install lockit-couchdb-adapter` |
  | [MongoDB](https://github.com/zeMirco/lockit-mongodb-adapter) | `npm install lockit-mongodb-adapter` |
  | [SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB or SQLite)](https://github.com/zeMirco/lockit-sql-adapter) | `npm install lockit-sql-adapter` |
  
  If you use a SQL database you also have to install the connector.
  
  ```
  npm install pg       # for postgres
  npm install mysql    # for mysql
  npm install sqlite3  # for sqlite
  npm install mariasql # for mariasql
  ```

## Configuration

You need a `config.js` somewhere in your app.

### Database connection

Add the database connection string to your `config.js`.
 
```js
// database settings for CouchDB
exports.db = 'http://127.0.0.1:5984/test';        // connection string for database

// or if you want to use MongoDB
// exports.db = 'mongodb://127.0.0.1/test';
// exports.dbCollection = 'users';                // collection name for MongoDB

// PostgreSQL
// exports.db = 'postgres://127.0.0.1:5432/users';
// exports.dbCollection = 'users';                // table name for SQL databases

// MySQL
// exports.db = 'mysql://127.0.0.1:9821/users';
// exports.dbCollection = 'users';

// SQLite
// exports.db = 'sqlite://:memory:';
// exports.dbCollection = 'users';
```
 
### Send emails

By default the email service is stubbed and no emails are sent. 
That means that you won't receive any signup and password reset tokens. 
You have to look them up in your database and call the routes manually (e.g. `/signup/:token`).
To send emails you need an email server and you have to change the settings in your `config.js`:

 - `emailType` - usually `SMTP`
 - `emailSettings` - see [nodemailer](https://github.com/andris9/Nodemailer) for more information
 
With [mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com/pricing) you can send up to 10,000 emails per month for free.

```js
exports.emailType = 'SMTP';
exports.emailSettings = {
  service: 'Mailgun',
  auth: {
    user: 'postmaster@username.mailgun.org',
    pass: 'secret-password'
  }
};
```

### Custom views

Lockit comes with built-in views which are based on Bootstrap.
If you want to use your own custom views you can. It is dead simple.

Put them into your `views` folder, for example `views/lockit/myLogin.jade`.
Then edit your `config.js` and set the path to your custom view.

```js
exports.login = {
  route: '/login',
  logoutRoute: '/logout',
  views: {
    login: 'lockit/myLogin.jade',
    loggedOut: 'lockit/myLogoutSuccess.jade'
  }
};
```

The only thing you have to keep in mind is the structure. The `login.views.login` view, for example,
needs a form element with two input fields. The `method` has to be `POST` and `action` should point
to your `login.route`. The input fields have to have the names `login` and `password`. If something
went wrong during the login process you'll get an `error` variable that you can use in your template.

Here is a minimalistic example for an alternative `myLogin.jade`.

```jade
extend /layout

block content
  h1 Login
  form(action="/login", method="POST")
    div
      label(for="login") Email or Username
      input(type="text", id="login", name="login", placeholder="Your email or username")
    div
      label(for="password") Password
      input(type="password", id="password", name="password", placeholder="Your password")
    if error
      p #{error}
    input(type="submit", value="Login")
```

For more information about each view see the `views` folder inside the different repositories.
Make sure your view extends `/layout` which is different to your normal views. They extend `layout`
without the slash. This is required to find the view.

### Events

Lockit emits the most important events for user authentication. Those are

 - `signup`
 - `login`
 - `logout`
 - `delete`
 
You can use these events to intercept requests and implement some custom logic, 
like getting the gravatar before sending a response to the client.
 
#### `signup`

A new user signed up. The callback function has two arguments.

- `user` is an object and contains information about the new user, like `user.username` or `user.email`.
- `res` is the standard Express.js `res` object with methods like `res.render` and `res.send`.
If you've set `signup.handleResponse` to `false` Lockit will not handle the response for you.
You therefore have to send the response back to the client manually or otherwise it will wait forever.
 
```js
lockit.on('signup', function(user, res) {
  // ...
});
```

##### `login`

A user logged in. Callback function this time has three arguments.

- `user` is again the JSON object containing info about that particular user.
- `res` is the normal Express.js response object with all properties and methods.
- `target` is the redirect target route after a successful login, i.e. `/settings`

```js
lockit.on('login', function(user, res, target) {
  // ...
});
```

##### `logout`

A user logged out. Same as above without the `target` string.

```js
lockit.on('logout', function(user, res) {
  // ...
});
```

##### `delete`

A user deleted an account. Same callback as above.

```js
lockit.on('delete', function(user, res) {
  // ...
});
```

### REST API

In a single page application (SPA) all the routing and template rendering is done on the client.
Before version 0.5.0 Lockit caught relevant routes, like `/login` or `/signup`,
and did the entire rendering on the server.

Starting with version 0.5.0 you're able to use Lockit as a REST API and communicate via JSON.
All you have to do is set `exports.rest = true` in your `config.js`.

With REST enabled all default routes get a `/rest` prefix so you can catch `/login`
on the client. To allow for true page refreshes (i.e. user is at `/login` and refreshes the page)
all routes on the server, like `/login` and `/signup`, send the `index.html` from the `public/`
folder. From there your SPA has to take over.

Here is a short example how the process works.

1. User sends GET request for `/login`
2. Server has a route handler for this request and sends `index.html` back
3. Client router takes over and renders `/login` page
4. User enters credentials and submits the form
5. Client controller catches submit and sends POST via AJAX request to `/rest/login`
6. Server handles POST request and validates user credentials
7. Server sends status code `200` or some JSON with error message
8. Client reacts to JSON from server and redirects on success or shows error

I've built a [simple example](https://github.com/zeMirco/lockit/tree/master/examples/angular) 
using AngularJS on the client side.
 
### Example config

If you want to go crazy and customize all the things you can:

```js
// name for subject and email content
exports.appname = 'lockit - Test App';

// url for proper link generation
exports.url = 'http://localhost:3000';

// email settings (same as nodemailer)
exports.emailType = 'Stub';
exports.emailSettings = {
  service: 'none',
  auth: {
    user: 'none',
    pass: 'none'
  }
};

// email template from npm
exports.emailTemplate = 'lockit-template-blank';

// render views or json for single page apps
exports.rest = false;

// signup settings
exports.signup = {
  route: '/signup',
  tokenExpiration: '1 day',
  views: {
    signup: '',         // input fields 'username', 'email' and 'password' | local variable 'error' | POST /'signup.route'
    linkExpired: '',    // message link has expired | input field 'email' | POST /'signup.route'/resend-verification
    verified: '',       // message email is now verified and maybe link to /'login.route'
    signedUp: '',       // message email has been sent => check your inbox
    resend: ''          // input field 'email' | local variable 'error' | POST /'signup.route'/resend-verification
  },
  handleResponse: true  // let lockit handle the response after signup success
};

// login settings
exports.login = {
  route: '/login',
  logoutRoute: '/logout',
  views: {
    login: '',          // input fields 'login' and 'password' | POST /'login.route' | local variable 'error'
    loggedOut: ''       // message that user logged out
  },
  handleResponse: true  // let lockit handle the response after login/logout success
};

// forgot password settings
exports.forgotPassword = {
  route: '/forgot-password',
  tokenExpiration: '1 day',
  views: {
    forgotPassword: '', // input field 'email' | POST /'forgotPassword.route' | local variable 'error'
    newPassword: '',    // input field 'password' | POST /'forgotPassword.route'/#{token} | local variable 'error'
    changedPassword: '',// message that password has been changed successfully
    linkExpired: '',    // message that link has expired and maybe link to /'forgotPassword.route'
    sentEmail: ''       // message that email with token has been sent
  }
};

// delete account settings
exports.deleteAccount = {
  route: '/delete-account',
  views: {
    remove: '',         // input fields 'username', 'phrase', 'password' | POST /'deleteAccount.route' | local variable 'error'
    removed: ''         // message that account has been deleted
  },
  handleResponse: true  // let lockit handle the response after delete account success
};

// lock account
// show warning after three failed login attempts
exports.failedLoginsWarning = 3;
// lock account after five failed login attempts
exports.failedLoginAttempts = 5;
// lock account for 20 minutes
exports.accountLockedTime = '20 minutes';

// public email address of your app
exports.emailFrom = 'welcome@lock.it';

// email signup template
exports.emailSignup = {
  subject: 'Welcome to <%- appname %>',
  text: [
    '<h2>Hello <%- username %></h2>',
    'Welcome to <%- appname %>.',
    '<p><%- link %> to complete your registration.</p>'
  ].join(''),
  linkText: 'Click here'
};

// email already taken template
exports.emailSignupTaken = {
  subject: 'Email already registered',
  text: [
    '<h2>Hello <%- username %></h2>',
    'you or someone else tried to sign up for <%- appname %>.',
    '<p>Your email is already registered and you cannot sign up twice.',
    ' If you haven\'t tried to sign up, you can safely ignore this email. Everything is fine!</p>',
    '<p>The <%- appname %> Team</p>'
  ].join('')
};

// resend signup template
exports.emailResendVerification = {
  subject: 'Complete your registration',
  text: [
    '<h2>Hello <%- username %></h2>',
    'here is the link again. <%- link %> to complete your registration.',
    '<p>The <%- appname %> Team</p>'
  ].join(''),
  linkText: 'Click here'
};

// forgot password template
exports.emailForgotPassword = {
  subject: 'Reset your password',
  text: [
    '<h2>Hey <%- username %></h2>',
    '<%- link %> to reset your password.',
    '<p>The <%- appname %> Team</p>'
  ].join(''),
  linkText: 'Click here'
};
```
